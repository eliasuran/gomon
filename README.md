## Preview

* Automatic updates when making changes to your api ðŸš€

* Built for the net/http standard package ðŸ”¥



## Installation

### Homebrew (in progress)

### Manual installation

```sh
git clone https://github/eliasuran/gomon
cd gomon
go install
```

Run the program

```sh
gomon "path to dir with http server"
```

## Usage

```shell
gomon "path/to/dir/with/main.go/file"
```


* Run gomon and point to a directory containing a main.go file (currently only works with main.go files, working on fix)

* Gomon will build a binary and run it. When you make changes, it will automatically build a new binary with the latest changes.

* If it encounters an error, it will stay on the latest working version until the error is resolved.
